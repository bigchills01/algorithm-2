Initialize an empty dictionary called distinct_elements to keep track of the distinct elements from both sets.
Loop through each element in the first set.
Check if the element is already in the distinct_elements dictionary.
If the element is not in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
Loop through each element in the second set.
Check if the element is already in the distinct_elements dictionary.
If the element is not in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its value by 1.
Loop through each key-value pair in the distinct_elements dictionary.
If the value is 1, add the key to a running total of distinct elements.
Return the running total of distinct elements as the answer.
This algorithm ensures that each element is counted only once, even if it appears in both sets. The use of a dictionary allows for efficient tracking of whether an element has been seen before, and how many times it has been seen.
